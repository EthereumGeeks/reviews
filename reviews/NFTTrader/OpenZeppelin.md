## Summary
* TLDR of the findings

## File Review

### `contracts/AXBridge.sol`

Inherits the *onlyOwner* modifier from OpenZepplin's *Ownable.sol*. I see no immediate cause for concern from its implementation.

### `contracts/Pausable.sol`

Inherits the *onlyOwner* modifier from OpenZepplin's *Ownable.sol*. I see no immediate cause for concern from its implementation.
